58,"Sira: Okay, well, I've been reading about how the storming of the Bastille wasn't actually as significant as many believe, more of a symbolic event than a major turning point in the revolution itself.

It's pretty fascinating stuff.",7.0,observation,1749639805.489056
63,Dad: what other subjects do you like ??,2.0,observation,1749639861.601142

And I also like Art History; it’s fascinating to see how artistic styles reflect the social and political changes of different eras.  Actually, there's a great connection between the artistic styles of the Neoclassical period and the ideals of the French Revolution….",7.0,observation,1749639865.975536
